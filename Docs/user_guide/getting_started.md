# Getting Started: A Quick Tour

This guide provides a walkthrough of the main interface of the Shipping Form Creator.

## Main Window Overview

The application's main window is divided into three primary sections:

![Main Window Layout](https://i.imgur.com/your-image-url.png)  <!-- Placeholder for an image of the main window -->

1.  **Navigation Panel (Left)**
    *   This panel contains the main navigation buttons to switch between the two primary document types:
        *   **Packing List:** The default view, used for creating and managing packing lists.
        *   **Bill of Lading:** Used for generating the final Bill of Lading for the carrier.

2.  **Action & Search Panel (Center)**
    *   This is your main control panel for finding, managing, and printing documents.
    *   **1. Search for order number:** Enter a 6-digit sales order number and a 2-digit suffix to load a specific order. Press `Enter` or click `Search`.
    *   **2. Search by ship date:** Use the date picker to find all orders that were shipped on a specific date.
    *   **3. Save Changes:** Click the `Save` button to store any modifications you've made to a packing list. This is crucial for handling units and other user-entered data.
    *   **4. Print Document:** Once a document is loaded and ready, use the `Print` button to send it to your printer.

3.  **Content Area (Right)**
    *   This large area displays the currently selected document, whether it's a packing list, a bill of lading, or search results. This is where you will interact with the details of the shipment.

## Basic Workflow

A typical workflow in the application looks like this:

1.  **Select Document Type:** Choose either `Packing List` or `Bill of Lading` from the left navigation panel.
2.  **Load an Order:** Use the search functions in the center panel to find and load the sales order you need to work with.
3.  **Modify the Document:**
    *   For a **Packing List**, you might organize items into `Handling Units` (covered in a later section).
    *   For a **Bill of Lading**, you will review the summarized information.
4.  **Save Your Changes:** Click `Save` to ensure any work you've done is not lost.
5.  **Print the Document:** Click `Print` to generate the physical copy.

Now that you're familiar with the layout, the following sections will dive deeper into the specific features of the application.
